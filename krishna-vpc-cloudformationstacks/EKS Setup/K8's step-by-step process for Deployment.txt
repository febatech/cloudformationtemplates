prequisites: You need to have aws cli and and you should have access for EKS,EC2,VPC,Cloudformation Services for your IAM user.

step1:
Execute a Bootstrap script for creating eksctl and kubectl.  
Command to execute:
./kube.sh

step2:
We are Creating cluster and node groups using yaml file.
Command to execute yaml file:
eksctl create cluster -f cluster.yaml

step3:
create a deployment for image to run inside the cluster.
aws eks list-clusters                     # shows created list of clusters
kubectl get pods                          # shows number of pods and its status
kubectl get nodes -o wide                 # shows number of nodes and its status 
kubectl get replicaset                    # shows replica sets of images
kubectl get svc                           # shows exposed nginx containers
eksctl delete cluster --name testcluster  # deletes cluster
kubectl delete deployment (deployment-name) # for deleting deployment
kubectl -n default delete pods --field-selector=status.phase=Failed   # to delete pods in failed state

#applying our deployment file 
kubectl apply -f myeks.yaml

step4:
Finally we can expose our nginx containers using this command:
kubectl expose deployment/my-dp1 \
        --port=80 --target-port=80 \
        --name=my-nginx-service --type=LoadBalancer
kubectl get svc   # shows exposed nginx containers
