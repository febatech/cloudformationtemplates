# With this Template We can Deploy new Vpc and Subnets and can launch Instances using AMI-Id in the Default Region with Autoscaling and Loadbalancing Resources. 

Resources defined in the Cloudformation template:
* Vpc: 1
* Public Subnets: 3
* Internet Gateway: 1
* Routing Table: 1
* Launch templates: 1
* Autoscaling Group: 1
* Application Load balancer: 1
* Ec2 Instances: Desired 

Description:
* With this Cloudformation template We can deploy new Vpc with 3Publicsubnets and Internetgateway attached to VPC. With-in this template We are creating Routetable for Subnet-association and also we are adding an Internet gateway in the Routingtable for sending traffic from the subnets. In addition we are creating a Launch template with Ec2 properties and also creating an Autoscaling group with the launch template as a source. By default it Launches 1Ec2 instances from the specified AMI-ID. Finally we are enabling Application Loadbalancer to balance the traffic for the desired Ec2 instances in the Autoscaling group. 

Steps for Launching this Cloudformation template:

1) You can get this cloudformation template with the name “ONEMERIT-VPC.yaml” from this Github Url:    
         https://github.com/krishnadeepak25/Onemerit-Cloudformation/blob/master/ONEMERIT-VPC.yaml
         
2) After cloning the template, jump to aws console and select Cloudformation service there we can upload our template from our localhost. 

3) After uploading the template click on next, you can specify your stack details and parameters like Instancetype, keyname, ssh location, VpcCidr, ImageId and most importantly AutoScalingGroupDesiredCapacity.

4) On the next step you can go with default stack configuration options so click on next.

5) Finally click on “Create Stack” for deploying all the resources in the template and we can also delete all the resources by clicking on “Delete Stack”.
