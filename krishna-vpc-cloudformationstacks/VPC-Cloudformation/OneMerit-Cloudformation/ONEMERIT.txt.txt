# With this Template we can Launch Instances using AMI-Id in the Existing Vpc and Subnet ID's with the Autoscaling and Loadbalancing resources. 

Resources defined in the Cloudformation template:
* Launch templates: 1
* Autoscaling Group: 1
* Application Load balancer: 1
* Ec2 Instances: Desired 

Description:
* With this Cloudformation template We are creating a Launch template with Ec2 properties and also creating an Autoscaling group with the launch template as a source. By default it Launches Desired Ec2 instances from the specified AMI-ID. Finally we are enabling Application Loadbalancer to balance the traffic for the desired Ec2 instances in the Autoscaling group in the Existing Vpc and Subnet ID's. 

Steps for Launching this Cloudformation template:

1) You can get this cloudformation template with the name “ONEMERIT-VPC.yaml” from this Github Url:    
        https://github.com/krishnadeepak25/Onemerit-Cloudformation/blob/master/ONEMERIT.yaml
         
2) After cloning the template, jump to aws console and select Cloudformation service there we can upload our template from our localhost. 

3) After uploading the template click on next, you can specify your stack details and parameters like Instancetype, keyname, ssh location, VpcCidr, SubnetCidr, SecuritygroupdId's, ImageId and most importantly AutoScalingGroupDesiredCapacity.

4) On the next step you can go with default stack configuration options so click on next.

5) Finally click on “Create Stack” for deploying all the resources in the template and we can also delete all the resources by clicking on “Delete Stack”.
